I want to split javascript up into seperate files based on what code is handling what aspects of the site

Here are the JS files and their functions that they need to do

auth.js //functions for handling user data, creating new users and logging people in with google or github or what
render.js //automates some aspects of page rendering
main.js //will be the only file to call functions defined by other files (exceptions may apply) applies functions from render js and handles: scoring, scoreboard, chat?, gamelogic, etc
submit.js // for the place where you submit new puzzles. idk if this really needs to be here but idk the more files there are the easier it is to collaborate
